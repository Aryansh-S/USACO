The segment tree is one of the most versatile structures in all of contest programming. The intuition behind the innerworkings
is fairly simple compared to that of a Fenwick Tree. Yet, unfortunately, segment trees are not so easy to implement. 

The goal of this library is to create the most generic, extensible segment tree data structures around, bridging the gap 
between implementation difficulty and solution:
- Standard Segment Tree (Generic Point Update, Generic Range Query): Complete!
- Lazy Propagation Segment Tree (Generic Range Update, Generic Range Query): Complete!

The final library will be put into a single namespace and will be designed for ease of use. The beauty of such a library is that you do not even have to engage with its full spectrum of complexity if you need not! Default values are assigned to arguments based on typical contest requirements. 

RELEASE (v1) : check the "SegTreeLib.cpp" file!
