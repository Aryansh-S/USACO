# Segment Tree Library

## Description
Easy segment trees for general use 
- "iterativesegtree.cpp" : Point Update, Range Query 
- "rng_upd_pt_qry.cpp" : Range Update, Point Query (Order Matters)

## Memory

Memory provides a strong advantage -- no more than twice N is used, with thrice N in the lazy case. Memory allocation is taken care of in init functions for the sake of vectors and arrays, although seg is always stored as a vector regardless due to flexibility.
