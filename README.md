# USACO
Competitive Programming Resources &amp; Implementations

A compilation of resources and implementations for contest programming -- algorithms and past problems for USACO.
You can find the latest version of my contest programming template (ongoing modification) in "template.cpp"; please credit
before use in-contest. 
If you want to #include <bits/stdc++.h> but your compiler does not allow you to do so, simply go to the file "stdc++.h" and
follow the unofficial directions at the top.
