Try the following.

- Analyze bounds and time complexity to reverse-engineer potential algorithms in the problem

- Draw a picture

- Work out the sample case

- Approach the problem from a different angle (backwards, sideways, etc.)

- Start with brute force and work toward pruning optimizations (even go for amortized analysis because heuristic solutions might suffice for the test cases)

- Gauge time and remember partial credit for test cases

- Move on to another problem/take a break and come back with a fresh mind

- Look out for edge cases! If things are 1-indexed, you can either leave them be by just increasing the array size (usually a good habit to have regardless), or you can 0-index them as necessary

- Look out for integer overflow! Use long long (64-bit integer type) if necessary (usually indicated by the problem)

- Try small cases or special cases

- Add single or multiline comments to keep track of what you are doing

- Debugging: add print statements (use what(x) in the template or some variant), watch out for segmentation faults (accessing out of bounds memory or too much memory), literally rewrite code as a last resort

- Stay organized and do not panic
