Where to start learning? Here are some essential resources. 

First and foremost: the problem sets -- you need to develop intuition

https://github.com/SuprDewd/T-414-AFLV (a rigorous, open source course that guides you through a proper treatment of competitive programming)

https://cses.fi/problemset/ (an amazing problem set that guides you through algorithmic concepts in competitive programming -- great for standardized concept exposition)

USACO Past Problems (always your best bet if you know the theory -- remember to upsolve and work on implementation even if you decide to resort to editorials + even if you solve a problem yourself, read the editorial anyway -- you might learn something)


CP3 -- this is a very good reference for contestants towards the advanced end of the competitive programming spectrum
- On a related note, see the open source project with great implementations to get started: https://github.com/stevenhalim/cpbook-code

CSES -- a well-developed coverage of algorithmic CS in competitive context

Undergraduate Topics in CS : Guide to Competitive Programming -- built upon CSES but more advanced and thorough on a conceptual level, this book provides a more detailed exposition into contest programming 

CLRS -- a must have for all intents and purposes in algorithmic learning; certainly a good starting point for problem solving skills

KACTL -- meant as more of a technique & implementation reference guide (more so than a "textbook"); extremely dense but comprehensive and well-written

You choose what you want to start with, but pace yourself through the content and focus on building intuition.
