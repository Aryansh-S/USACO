Where to start learning? Here are some essential resources. 

CP3 -- this is a very good reference for contestants towards the advanced end of the competitive programming spectrum
- On a related note, see the open source project with great implementations to get started: https://github.com/stevenhalim/cpbook-code

CSES -- a well-developed coverage of algorithmic CS in competitive context

Undergraduate Topics in CS : Guide to Competitive Programming -- built upon CSES but more advanced and thorough on a conceptual level, this book provides a more detailed exposition into contest programming 

CLRS -- a must have for all intents and purposes in algorithmic learning; certainly a good starting point for problem solving skills
