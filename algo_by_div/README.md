Comprehensive algorithm implementations for each USACO division from bronze through gold based on classifications from the [Unofficial USACO Syllabus](https://www.overleaf.com/read/fktckfprxyxn)

Study these thoroughly to do well! Don't just memorize the implementation -- seek to understand why it works. The intuition behind why could be useful for problems where these implementations can't be applied directly.
