## Description

Comprehensive algorithm implementations for each USACO division from bronze through gold based on classifications from the [Unofficial USACO Syllabus](https://www.overleaf.com/read/fktckfprxyxn). Currently a WIP. 

Study these thoroughly to do well! Don't just memorize the implementation -- seek to understand why it works. The intuition behind why could be useful for problems where these implementations can't be applied directly. 

## Updates

## Note on Use

USACO no longer allows prewritten code. As such, you may not directly copy and paste code from these files in contest. Instead, I recommend committing the important features of these implementations to memory through constant practice writing them from scratch. However, if you'd like to use this code on another platform that allows prewritten code (e.g., Codeforces), or just in your practice USACO submissions, please include a comment like the following near the top of the file:
